Cordova-POC has been created to help to do demo of your Cordova app to customer on-the-fly. 
Idea is to deploy Html5 application bundle (i.e. zip file) directly on device from either on-line than off-line source. 
Moreover Cordova-POC collects the deployed applications, providing a personal applications gallery, always ready to run.
